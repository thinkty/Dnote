# Darc

Darc is a web application for archiving your notes and references related to debugging. The ideal usage is to use Darc side by side as users learn a new language or work on a new type of project. I am currently developing on Darc and am open to any ideas on features and also feedbacks on my code.

# Core Features! (WIP)

  - Basic authentication / registration / profile management
  - Create / remove / edit notes
  - Search / filter notes
  - Export notes

# New Feature Plans

  - Share your notes in read-only mode using a unique URL
  - Search not only for notes, but also on [Stackoverflow]
  - Make the web application a Progressive Web Application

### Tech

Darc uses the following tools and frameworks :

* [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Material-UI] - React UI framework
* [node.js], [Express], [Mongoose] - quick and easy backend server
* [MongoDB] - general purpose, document-based, distributed database

### Installation

Currently, Darc does not need any installation. However, I plan to make it into a PWA so that the app can be easily accessible on variable platforms.
